description: Build a clean, modern, accessible, factually faithful pharmacy website from a build folder. Use when the user asks to "build pharmacy site," "build pharmacy website," generate a site from a "pharmacy build sheet," kick off a "Lumistry pharmacy build," or names a known template label such as "Longhorn." The skill takes a path to a build folder containing a build sheet (.docx) plus optional supporting docs and a logo, scrapes the pharmacy's existing live site for facts and assets, and produces a multi-page site that satisfies a strict output contract (required pages, WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility, SEO + JSON-LD schema, voice and PHI guardrails). Stack-agnostic — the agent picks the framework.

# Pharmacy Builder Skill

> The Contract half (below) defines what the build must satisfy. The Process half at the end defines the order in which steps run. Every step in Process references a Contract section by name. Read the whole document before starting a build.

## Inputs

You are given a path to a build folder. Scan it and resolve every file before doing anything else.

### Input folder layout

| File | Required? | Discovery rule |
|---|---|---|
| Build Sheet (`*.docx`) | **Required** | Filename contains `Build Sheet` |
| Logo (PNG/JPG/SVG) | **Required** | Image in folder root, or fetched from the `Logo:` URL in the build sheet |
| `Website content*.docx` | Optional | Filename matches `*content*.docx` |
| `QA *.docx` | Optional | Filename matches `QA *.docx` |
| `SEO_META_Tags_*.docx` | Optional | Filename matches `SEO_META*.docx` |
| Extra images, PDFs, videos | Optional | Any other media in the folder; catalog for possible reuse |
| Word lockfiles (`~$*.docx`) | Ignored | Skip entirely — do not parse or surface |

Hard fail if the Build Sheet is missing. Warn and continue if the logo is missing.

### Build sheet fields to extract

Extract every field listed below. Mark absent fields `null` with a `nullReason`. Do not invent values.

- **Pharmacy name**
- **address** (street, city, state, ZIP)
- **hours** (all open days and times, exactly as written)
- **phone**
- **fax**
- **email**
- **Website URL** (the pharmacy's existing live site — seed for the scrape step)
- **New Website URL** (staging/target; used as the canonical base URL)
- **Google Map URL**
- **refill portal** URL
- **Transfer-form requirement** (yes/no)
- **Requires Mobile App Page** flag (yes/no)
- **GA ID** (Google Analytics measurement ID)
- **head JS** snippet (verbatim; wired into `<head>` during generation)
- **brand color** (hex value)
- **Logo URL** (if not a local file)
- **Package label**
- **Template label** (e.g., "Longhorn" — see policy below)
- **services topics** (deeper-treatment services; each gets its own page)
- **services list** (shallow-card services; listed on the services index only)
- **Per-service description copy** for each Topic entry
- **immunization options** (list exactly as written; never extend)
- **year opened**
- **tagline**
- **about** copy
- **pickup methods** (drives `/refill/` copy)
- **Additional locations** flag (yes/no)
- **Social links** (if present)

### Conditional flags

Respect these flags exactly; do not activate conditional pages or features without a matching flag:

- **`Requires Mobile App Page: Yes`** → build the `/app/` page with real Apple App Store and Google Play badges wired to the URLs in the build sheet.
- **Refill portal URL present** → wire the Refill CTA to that URL across the site.
- **`Requires transfer form page`** → wire the `/transfer/` page's CTA / outbound link to the build-sheet transfer destination URL. The `/transfer/` page itself is always built (see §Required pages); this flag controls its wiring, never its existence. Still no PHI form.
- **`pickup methods`** → use the listed methods to drive the copy on `/refill/`.
- **`Additional locations: Yes`** → build a `/locations/` index page plus a `/locations/<slug>/` page per location.

### Template label policy

The build sheet may include a field like `Template: Longhorn`. Treat this as a label or hint only — it is not a binding template directive and does not constrain the design. Record it in build metadata and produce a clean, modern, unique design regardless.

### Output of this step

Write a single `build/context.json` that consolidates every parsed field from the build sheet plus any supporting docs (`Website content*.docx`, `QA *.docx`, `SEO_META_Tags_*.docx`). Each field must carry a `provenance` annotation: one of `build_sheet`, `content_doc`, `qa_doc`, `seo_doc`, or `scrape`. Absent fields must appear explicitly as `null` with a `nullReason` string — never omit them silently. This file is the single source of truth that all later steps quote from.

## Scrape

### Goal

Mirror the build sheet's `Website URL` field — the pharmacy's existing live site — to a local `/scraped/` folder. The scrape is a **fact source**, not a **design source**. The new site doesn't have to look like the old one; it only borrows verifiable facts, copy, and assets from it.

### Mechanics

Write and run `tools/scrape.mjs`. The skill defines the contract; Replit Agent owns the implementation.

- **Seed:** use the `Website URL` from the build sheet (the existing live site, not the staging URL).
- **Crawl rules:** same-origin only; depth ≤ 3; max 200 pages; rate-limit to 1 req/sec; send a descriptive User-Agent string; respect the source site's `robots.txt`; skip `mailto:`, `tel:`, anchor-only links, and tracker or CDN hosts.
- **Asset capture:** collect every `<img>`, `<source>`, `<video>`, and any `<a href>` pointing to `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.mp4`, `.webm`, or image extensions. Download each file to `/scraped/assets/` using collision-safe filenames that preserve the original name where possible.
- **Content capture:** save each crawled page as raw HTML at `/scraped/raw/<slug>.html` and as a reader-mode markdown extraction at `/scraped/text/<slug>.md` for LLM consumption.

### Manifest

Write `/scraped/manifest.json` after the crawl completes. For each page record: URL, HTTP status, final URL (after redirects), `<title>`, first `<h1>`, word count, list of referenced assets, and list of outbound internal links. This file plus the `/scraped/text/*.md` corpus are the handoff to the Plan and Generate steps.

### Failure handling

If the source site is unreachable — DNS failure, HTTP 403, or blocked by `robots.txt` — log `scrape_status: "unreachable"` to `/build/log.md` and continue with build-sheet-only content. There is no silent fallback — log the failure explicitly so downstream steps know the scrape was skipped.

### Allowed uses of scraped content

- **Fact source:** claimed services, awards, staff names, hours phrasing — every claim is still subject to §Factual guardrails before use.
- **PDFs** (forms, brochures) that may be linked from the new site when relevant.
- **Storefront, team, and product images** with generated alt text.

### Disallowed uses

- **Overriding the build sheet on conflict.** Build sheet wins; log every conflict to `/build/log.md`.
- **Carrying over PHI** (patient testimonials with full names paired with conditions, Rx numbers, DOB, etc.) — redact per §PHI rules.
- **Carrying over marketing hyperbole, comparative claims, clinical claims, or unverified credentials** — filter per §Voice and §Factual guardrails.

## Required pages

### Always-built pages

Every build must produce the following eight pages regardless of build-sheet flags:

| URL | Page | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Home | Hero, tagline, services grid, hours, trust callouts, testimonials, CTAs |
| `/about/` | About | Pharmacy story, year opened, tagline, independence |
| `/contact/` | Contact | Address, hours, phone, fax, email, map embed, directions link |
| `/services/` | Services index | Cards for every service (Topics deep + List shallow) |
| `/services/<slug>/` | Per-service detail | One page per "Topics" entry; deep treatment with copy |
| `/refill/` | Refill | Refill portal CTA wired to build-sheet URL; pickup methods copy |
| `/transfer/` | Transfer | CTA + outbound link only — no PHI form |
| `/faq/` | FAQ | Site-wide FAQs (expandable accordion); FAQPage JSON-LD schema |

> **Transfer page is CTA + outbound link only — no PHI form.** Do not add any form that collects patient health information on the `/transfer/` page.

**Per-service page depth:**
- **Topics entries** → deep treatment: full descriptive copy, benefits list, JSON-LD, internal links.
- **List entries** → shallow card only on the `/services/` index; no dedicated detail page.

### Conditionally built pages

| Condition | Pages built |
|---|---|
| `Requires Mobile App Page: Yes` | `/app/` — includes real Apple App Store badge and Google Play badge (correct artwork per each store's brand guidelines) |
| `Additional locations: Yes` | `/locations/` index + `/locations/<slug>/` per location |
| Scrape-discovered page with ≥ 150 substantive words, not a contact/hours rehash | `/<slug>/` — one page per qualifying scrape discovery |

**Scrape-discovery rule:** include a scraped page only when it contains at least 150 substantive words AND its content is not a rehash of the contact page or hours information. Drop it otherwise.

## Required sections

### Every page

Every page carries four structural zones in this order: top bar, sticky header, page body, footer.

**Top bar** — a slim bar above the header. Display the pharmacy address, phone number, and hours summary. Include an open-now indicator: compute open/closed status in the browser using `Date.now()` against the pharmacy's local timezone derived from the build sheet `Hours:` field. If JavaScript is disabled the indicator falls back to the text "Open/Closed unavailable" — it never invents a status it cannot confirm. Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to resolve local time from the user's browser; do not hard-code UTC offsets.

**Sticky header** — fixed to the top of the viewport on scroll. Contains: logo (linked to `/`), primary nav with a services dropdown that lists every service topic, and three CTAs in this order: Refill, Transfer, Patient Portal. The header never wraps to a second row at desktop widths.

**Footer** — contains: full address, phone, fax, email, business hours, social links (only if scraped or present in build sheet), NPI and license numbers (only if found in source material — never fabricated), copyright line, accessibility statement link, and a sitemap link. Omit any footer field whose value is not available in the build context.

**FAQs** — every page includes a FAQ section near the bottom, scoped to the page's topic, drawn from the build sheet and scrape corpus. Include a `FAQPage` JSON-LD block for each FAQ section — see §Schema (JSON-LD).

### Home only

The home page body contains the following sections in order:

1. **Hero** — full-width banner using the build-sheet tagline and a primary CTA (Refill or Transfer, whichever is primary per the build sheet). Background image sourced from scraped or provided assets; never use stock photography placeholders.
2. **Services grid** — card grid for every service (Topics + List). Each card has its own icon drawn from a single coherent icon set, line style, approximately 24×24 px, single-stroke, and recolorable via `currentColor`. The same icon set is reused in the header services dropdown — never mix sets.
3. **Hours of operation** — a semantic `<table>` listing every open day and its hours exactly as written in the build sheet.
4. **Trust callouts** — brief value statements (locally owned, years in business, etc.). No comparative claims ("best," "only," "most").
5. **Testimonials** — patient or customer quotes from the build sheet or scrape. Testimonials are omitted if no source material exists — never fabricated. Redact any PHI.
6. **App download row** — only if `Requires Mobile App Page: Yes` is set in the build sheet. Include real Apple App Store and Google Play badges wired to the URLs from the build sheet.

### Contact only

The contact page body contains:

- Clickable address (links to the Google Maps entry), clickable phone, fax, and email.
- Map embed: construct the embed URL from the build sheet `Google Map URL` field. Render a "Get directions" link that opens the Google Maps URL in a new tab (`target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`).
- No contact form — the contact page does not collect any patient data.
- Full hours of operation table (same as home).
- FAQs scoped to location and access questions.

### Per-service page

Each per-service detail page (one per Topics entry) follows this structure:

- **H1 = service name** — exactly as written in the build sheet Topics list; do not rename or abbreviate.
- Verbatim build-sheet description copy followed by any additional detail sourced from the scrape.
- For the Immunizations service: include a list labeled **Immunization Options** reproducing the build sheet `immunization options` field exactly — never extend or supplement this list with vaccines not explicitly listed in the build sheet.
- A CTA appropriate to the service (e.g., "Schedule Now," "Request a Refill") — wire to the correct portal URL.
- FAQs scoped to that service's topic.

### Iconography rule

Use one coherent icon set across the entire site (e.g., Lucide, Heroicons, or Phosphor). Pick one set and commit to it. The same icon set appears in the services grid cards and the header services dropdown — never mix two icon families. All icons must be rendered at a consistent size (approximately 24×24 px), use a single-stroke line style, and accept brand-color theming via `currentColor` so they inherit the text color of their container without hardcoded fill values.

### Section omission rule

Any required section whose content cannot be sourced from the build sheet, supporting docs, or scrape corpus is omitted, not stubbed. Do not insert placeholder text. Specifically:

- No "Lorem ipsum" — never use filler Latin text.
- No "Coming soon" — never stub a section with a coming-soon notice.
- No fake content of any kind. If the data isn't there, the section isn't there.

## Voice

- Write in plain language targeting an 8th-grade reading level. Target a Flesch-Kincaid readability score of ≥ 70.
- Use short sentences. Active voice only — never passive construction when active is possible.
- Second person throughout: address the patient as "you" ("you can get your refill"), never third person ("patients can…").
- Warm but not casual. Friendly, not flippant. Professional tone that reassures; never breezy, sarcastic, or colloquial.
- Practical: tell the patient what to do, where to go, and what to expect. Every paragraph should answer one of: what is this, how do I get it, what happens next.
- local-color claims — community, neighborhood, family-owned, independent — are allowed only if backed by the build sheet or scrape corpus. Apply the same test to every local-color claim: if there is no source, omit the claim.

## Banned phrasings

The phrases below are forbidden in all generated HTML and copy. They are grouped by category for reference. The same list is the grep corpus that `tools/validate-content.mjs` runs against every output file.

### Marketing hyperbole

- revolutionary
- world-class
- best-in-class
- cutting-edge
- state-of-the-art
- industry-leading
- premier
- award-winning
- voted #1
- top-rated

### Clinical / comparative claims

- proven to
- cures
- guarantees
- safest
- fastest
- unlike CVS
- you should take

### Operational overreach

- all insurance
- any insurance
- every insurance
- 24-hour
- 24/7
- same-day delivery
- free delivery

### Credentials

- board-certified
- PharmD
- RPh

### Verification mechanism

`tools/validate-content.mjs` scans all generated HTML after every build. If any banned phrase is found, the tool will fail build with a non-zero exit code and write line-numbered evidence to `/build/log.md` so the exact location of each violation is visible for review and correction.

**Conditional unlock:** a banned phrase is allowed only when its exact wording appears verbatim in the build sheet or scrape (e.g., "FREE local delivery" when a build sheet contains that exact phrase). In that case the phrase may be reproduced faithfully in the corresponding page copy; the validator must be configured to accept the specific override when triggered by the build sheet or scrape source text.
